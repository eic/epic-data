This directory contains the gdml geometry files for the ePIC barrel hadronic calorimeter absorber structure as well as the orginal CAD step files and the FreeCAD projects used to generate the GDML. 

STEP Files: 
-----------

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM.STEP*: Original geometry STEP file received from sPHENIX engineers. Note that this contains the magnet poletips for sPHENIX that are not a part of ePIC. These must be removed. 

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM_Full.STEP*: STEP file created using SolidWorks 2021 and removing the sPHENIX poletips. Written out in AP214 STEP format. 

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM_Full_NoCombs.STEP*: STEP file created using SolidWorks 2021 and removing the sPHENIX poletips and HCAL plate combs. These combs are complicated and generate complicated tessellated model, which is not really necessary for the G4 simulations. Written out in AP214 STEP format. 

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM_Plates_EndPlates_Only.STEP*: STEP file created using SolidWorks 2021 and removing the sPHENIX poletips, combs and dogbone rings. Written out in AP214 STEP format. 

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM_Plates_EndPlates_Only.STEP*: STEP file created using SolidWorks 2021 and removing the sPHENIX poletips, combs, dogbone rings and endplates. Written out in AP214 STEP format. This is usually used in debugging the tile placement in DD4HEP as it allows better visibility in the viewer. 

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM_Sector_NoCombs.STEP*: STEP file extracted from the full geometry for a single HCAL sector. The sector combs have been removed.  

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM_ChimneySector_NoCombs.STEP*: STEP file extracted from the full geometry for a single HCAL chimney sector. The sector combs have been removed.  

*2021MAY12_sPHENIX_CM_EndRing.STEP*: STEP file extracted from the full geometry for the end ring ("dogbones").   



FreeCAD File: 
-------------

The FreeCAD files follow the same naming convention as the STEP files above. The files were created by importing the relevant STEP file above in the GDML workbench and translating the imported structure to y=-3959.37mm to remove an offset in the original CAD model. If the dogbone rings are included they are translated to create a 1mm gap between the endplates and dogbone rings to avoid numerical precision errors creating overlap errors on contact surfaces between the parts. 

These files were created with FreeCAD version 0.21 using GDML workbench v2.0 Beta. 

*preMesh*: Project with imported geometry prior to creating the mesh

*Union_preMesh*: When the endplates are included the plates and endplates must be combined in a FreeCAD Fusion to avoid numerical precision errors creating overlap errors on contact surfaces between the parts.   

*Meshed*: Project with the meshed solids, ready for GDML export

GDML Files: 
-----------

These files can be accessed directly by the simulation by editing the epic/compact/hcal/barrel_gdml.xml file. The availability of multiple versions aids in debugging as well as verifying the effects/utility of increasing complex absorber geometry. 

*barrel_hcal_steel_full.gdml*: The full ePIC barrel HCAL geometry, including the sector combs.  This is a vert large tesselated object. 

*barrel_hcal_steel_full_nocombs.gdml*: The ePIC barrel HCAL geometry, excluding the sector combs.  *This is the DD4HEP default for ePIC Simulations.*

*barrel_hcal_steel_plates_endplates_only.gdml*: Simplified ePIC barrel HCAL geometry, with only the absorber plates and endplates.  The dogbone rings are not included. 

*barrel_hcal_steel_plates_only.gdml*: Very simplified ePIC barrel HCAL geometry, with only the absorber plates.  The dogbone rings and endplates are not included. 

*barrel_hcal_steel_sector_nocombs.gdml*: Single HCAL sector without sector combs. 

*barrel_hcal_steel_chimneysector_nocombs.gdml*: Single HCAL chimney sector without sector combs. 

*barrel_hcal_steel_sector_endring.gdml*: Single end-ring (dogbones)


The GDML had to be hand edited to fix two issues: 

- The units needed to be added to the identity matrix definition at the end of the <define> section: 

<rotation name="identity" x="0" y="0" z="0" unit="deg"/> 

- The <structure> and <setup> sections at the very end of the file were simplified to: 

<structure>
  <volume name="BarrelHCalSteel">
    <solidref ref="Mesh2Tess"/>
  </volume>
</structure>
<setup name="Default" version="1.0">
    <world ref="BarrelHCalSteel"/>
</setup>


Note that the material for the structure is defined in barrel HCAL xml file.
